                        <p className='intro-txt'>The fashion industry is slowly but surely starting to recognise the beauty in
                            all body types. We hear talk about size inclusive fashion and see plus size models across ad campaigns.
                            However, this appreciation falls short when it comes to actual shoppable fashion choices in store. Sizeupp
                            is here to fix just this.
                        </p>

                            We have created a brand that is dedicated solely to plus size fashion and understanding the nuances that
                            come with it. At Sizeupp, plus size clothing is not just a small tab on a large website. It IS the entire website.

                        <p className='intro-txt'>Sizeupp was founded on the fundamental belief that fashion should not be
                            limited to a specific size range. It should be a welcoming space for all body shapes and sizes.
                            We envision a world where every plus size individual can easily find trendy, comfortable, and high-quality
                            clothing that not only
                            fits their bodies but also gives them the ability to express themselves through fashion.</p>
                        <p className='intro-txt'>Our core values are authenticity, inclusivity and self-expression. Sizeupp is dedicated to celebrating these values through its designs,
                            models and marketing campaigns. Thus ensuring that our customers feel seen and represented.</p>
